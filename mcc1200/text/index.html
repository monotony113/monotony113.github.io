        <p>My research topic for the final project is on the development and use of <strong>facial
                recognition technology,</strong> or FRT, in China, and my presentation will focus on an overview
            of the <em>controversies, perceptions, and sentiments</em> involving FRT in China in recent years. In an
            attempt to explain such perceptions and sentiments, I will also go into details on some contexts about FRT
            and AI in China. Specifically, I will talk about <strong>platform urbanism and smart cities.</strong></p>

        <p>Some introduction on the current state of FRT development in China. Although research into computer vision,
            in general, started much later in China in comparison to the US, beginning in the early 2010s, China has
            been consistently ranked at the first in terms of published articles on facial recognition research.
            Solutions and prototypes by elite Chinese universities and homegrown FRT research companies have been
            outperforming other algorithms by American companies in some competitions. Furthermore, MegVii, the leading
            vendor of the technology backed by Alibaba, was in September 2019 sanctioned by the Trump administration
            over national security concerns and the company&#39;s suspected involvement in mass surveillance against the
            Uighur population. Geopolitics aside, the event signifies China’s FRT global prowess.</p>

        <p>In terms of usage, FRT saw its first major debut in China in 2015, when Alipay, still the countries largest
            mobile payment service provider, introduced the <em>“Smile to Pay”</em> function, allowing its users to
            authenticate for payment using their face. The product used MegVii’s algorithm. Since then, FRT has become
            ubiquitous in China, deployed on smartphones as face-swapping apps, at property entrances and in hospitals
            for checking in and outs, and at school exams for student verification.</p>

        <p>In contrast with such widespread adoption, however, is the <em>relatively scant debates</em> over the
            technology among the general public, as well as <em>non-existent national standards and regulations.</em>
            Nevertheless, a survey from last year conducted by the <em>Southern Metropolis Daily</em> newspaper revealed
            people’s concerns over FRT’s security and contextual appropriateness. The survey showed prevalent
            <em>approval of FRT’s convenience,</em> with most use cases such as <em>mobile payment and streamlined
                interactions</em> with government agencies receiving high scores. At the same time, a sizable amount of
            respondents complained about the <em>lack of choices</em> in some use cases, where FRT has become the sole,
            compulsory method of authentication. Furthermore, major worries about abuse of FRT include <em>leakage of
                facial feature data</em> itself, <em>persistent tracking</em> of daily activities, <em>financial
                loss</em> due to unauthorized access, and <em>identity theft.</em> Finally, survey respondents expressed
            the highest level of <em>distrust against private and commercial users</em> of FRT and the <em>highest level
                of trust for the government,</em> although even for private entities, the number of people expressing
            distrust and trust is roughly equal.</p>

        <p>The Southern Metropolis Daily survey and observations on online comments seem to suggest a few things. First,
            Chinese citizens, especially those who live in cities, have begun to express not only generic reservation
            but also some <em>concrete anxieties</em> about FRT — for example, uneasiness over potential fraud and
            identity theft that may happen because of unlawful third-party access to facial feature data. More
            strikingly, a sizable number of comments, especially those since this year, begin to articulate ideas such
            as, quote-unquote, <strong>reasonable use of FRT,</strong> many of which are also accompanied by optimism
            for proper regulation, citing legislative developments. When read in juxtaposition with sentiments regarding
            FRT in the United States, such expressions are striking in two ways. First, culture-specific judgments, such
            as FRT “infringing on civil liberties and freedom of expression,” are rarely part of the discussion in
            China. This is true even for people who have substantial experience with the American society and culture
            like exchange STEM students. Second, that the Chinese government should promote and regulate the so-called
            reasonable use of FRT differs starkly from popular opinions held by major civil liberties organizations such
            as ACLU, and an increasing number of American cities, from San Francisco, California to Portland, Oregon.
            These organizations and institutions have instead, as many of you have already known, consistently argued
            for a complete ban on the use of the technology.</p>

        <p>Then, in my effort to understand such differences, I look at the policy context on a national level to find
            out the environment in which FRT can grow in China. And it turns out that an important backdrop for FRT in
            China is the <strong>“smart cities”</strong> strategy. In week 12, our class discussed what’s called
            <strong>platform capitalism,</strong> where tech companies construct platforms, which can be seen as
            <em>data extraction apparatuses,</em> to experiment with new models of production and profit. Here, what
            China has been planning since the 2010s may be called <strong>“platform urbanism.”</strong> In other words,
            the Chinese government would like to design cities as platforms, with physical sensors throughout the city’s
            landscape, from smart street lights to smart main pipes, a centralized, AI-aided computer network to
            transport, store, and digest the enormous data that will be generated, as well as restructured municipal
            agencies capable of benefiting from such data exchange platforms to enhance their efficiency, while also
            feeding even more data back into the system.</p>

        <p>There are many reasons as to why the Chinese government sees smart cities as one of the top priorities, but
            the reasons that matter to the Chinese society the most, internally, come down to two points. The first one
            is that “digitizing” Chinese cities and breaking down information barriers are directly beneficial to
            boosting the government’s <strong>bureaucratic performance,</strong> <mark>which in turn contributes
                directly to the government’s <strong>legitimacy</strong> among its people.</mark> The second one is that
            advanced algorithms baked into smart city projects enable granular social control, which can be translated
            to what’s often called <strong>“public security (公共治安),”</strong> which is one of the paramount promises the
            Chinese government has to keep for its citizens.</p>

        <p>What I found out is that facial recognition technology is immensely helpful to both of these objectives. In
            terms of public security, as metropolises such as Shenzhen and Shanghai began to upgrade their already
            extensive video surveillance camera network with computer vision capabilities and install FRT-enabled
            checkpoints at subway stations, highway exits, railway terminals, and airports, municipal government find
            themselves suddenly in possession of minute details of millions of trajectories as people go on with their
            daily life. Such data constitute the raw material for <em>predictive policing and targeted law
                enforcement</em> in specific “troublesome” neighborhoods. In terms of administrative efficiency, for
            example, FRT as a form of personal identification mechanism is increasingly employed in hospitals and in
            government offices to streamline the interaction process and reduce the number of redundant paperwork.</p>

        <p>Yet meanwhile, the specific institutional logic that China shows in developing smart cities also underpins
            the flaws in FRT development that have contributed to the accumulating complaints and anxieties. Most
            importantly, <mark>although “smart cities” as an overarching design has always been a national interest, the
                <em>implementation</em> is never unified on a national level.</mark> Due to its enormous size, both
            geographically and demographically, it is nearly impossible for Beijing to attend to every detail of the
            design, and as a result, the central government delegates the design and construction of smart cities to
            <em>local governments.</em> On the local level, oftentimes governments alone can’t sponsor every part of the
            smart cities objectives as well, and therefore the R&amp;D of smart cities solutions are often carried out
            in the form of <strong>public-private partnerships,</strong> catering to specific local needs. Ultimately,
            this has resulted in <em>fragmented and uneven development,</em> meaning a lack of national standards and
            regulations, and the flourishing of thousands of small, regional companies providing smart cities solutions,
            which may be of varying, often subpar, quality. This thus explains the over-proliferation of FRT use in low
            profile settings, such as storefronts: whereas municipal governments themselves and enterprise-level
            institutions such as banks have the resources to pursue state-of-the-art FRT technologies, smaller users,
            such as stores, housing developments, schools, and parks will have to resort to homegrown vendors for
            cheaper solutions. The result, then, is the increasingly noticeable call to regulate the FRT market, which
            has already met with responses from the central government, in the forms of legislation and newly proposed
            national standards.</p>

        <p>The most interesting aspect throughout this research, therefore, is to see how the set of governmental logic
            that is specific to China has contributed to such drastically differing perceptions about facial recognition
            in China in comparison to that in the US. In my paper, I will further amend this discussion with the latest
            developments on the regulatory matters of FRT in China. I will also address some of the limitations of this
            research. In particular, I wish to still acknowledge the potential damage to personal liberty the technology
            will pose, even if such language is never a dominant part of Chinese society. I also wish to point out that
            all of these are discussed in the context of the <em>Han</em> Chinese society, and that the very same FRT
            solutions are known to be used in mass surveillance against the Uighur population, which has been an ongoing
            humanitarian crisis.</p>
